# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.

Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
