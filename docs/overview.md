# Building with Claude

> Claude is a family of [highly performant and intelligent AI models](/en/docs/about-claude/models) built by Anthropic. While Claude is powerful and extensible, it's also the most trustworthy and reliable AI available. It follows critical protocols, makes fewer mistakes, and is resistant to jailbreaksâ€”allowing [enterprise customers](https://claude.com/customers) to build the safest AI-powered applications at scale.

This guide introduces Claude's enterprise capabilities, the end-to-end flow for developing with Claude, and how to start building.

## What you can do with Claude

Claude is designed to empower enterprises at scale with strong performance across benchmark evaluations for reasoning, math, coding, and fluency in English and non-English languages.

Here's a non-exhaustive list of Claude's capabilities and common uses.

    * Identify a problem to solve or tasks to automate with Claude.
    * Define requirements: features, performance, and cost.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Design your integration">
    * Select Claude's capabilities (e.g., vision, tool use) and models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) based on needs.
    * Choose a deployment method, such as the Claude API, AWS Bedrock, or Vertex AI.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prepare your data">
    * Identify and clean relevant data (databases, code repos, knowledge bases) for Claude's context.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop your prompts">
    * Use Workbench to create evals, draft prompts, and iteratively refine based on test results.
    * Deploy polished prompts and monitor real-world performance for further refinement.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Implement Claude">
    * Set up your environment, integrate Claude with your systems (APIs, databases, UIs), and define human-in-the-loop requirements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your system">
    * Conduct red teaming for potential misuse and A/B test improvements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to production">
    * Once your application runs smoothly end-to-end, deploy to production.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor and improve">
    * Monitor performance and effectiveness to make ongoing improvements.
  </Step>
</Steps>
