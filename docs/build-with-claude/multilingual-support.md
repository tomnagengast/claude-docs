# Multilingual support

> Claude excels at tasks across multiple languages, maintaining strong cross-lingual performance relative to English.

## Overview

Claude demonstrates robust multilingual capabilities, with particularly strong performance in zero-shot tasks across languages. The model maintains consistent relative performance across both widely-spoken and lower-resource languages, making it a reliable choice for multilingual applications.

Note that Claude is capable in many languages beyond those benchmarked below. We encourage testing with any languages relevant to your specific use cases.

## Performance data

<Note>
  These metrics are based on [MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMLU) English test sets that were translated into 14 additional languages by professional human translators, as documented in [OpenAI's simple-evals repository](https://github.com/openai/simple-evals/blob/main/multilingual_mmlu_benchmark_results.md). The use of human translators for this evaluation ensures high-quality translations, particularly important for languages with fewer digital resources.

## Best practices

When working with multilingual content:

1. **Provide clear language context**: While Claude can detect the target language automatically, explicitly stating the desired input/output language improves reliability. For enhanced fluency, you can prompt Claude to use "idiomatic speech as if it were a native speaker."
2. **Use native scripts**: Submit text in its native script rather than transliteration for optimal results
3. **Consider cultural context**: Effective communication often requires cultural and regional awareness beyond pure translation

We also suggest following our general [prompt engineering guidelines](/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview) to better improve Claude's performance.

## Language support considerations

* Claude processes input and generates output in most world languages that use standard Unicode characters
* Performance varies by language, with particularly strong capabilities in widely-spoken languages
* Even in languages with fewer digital resources, Claude maintains meaningful capabilities
